\chapter{Conclusion}

We proposed an ASR system in Bangla for Pipilika voice search. We have used DNN-HMM and GMM-HMM-based acoustic model built with Kaldi for Bangla. Here we have added 1035 isolated words with 9324 utterances from 91 different speakers  Bangla word to the corpus. We used B-ToBI model of Bengali intonation that was not used earlier. We trained them to build our DNN-HMM and GMM-HMM-based acoustic model.


\par In offline decoding, it is observed that DNN-HMM acoustic DNN-HMM acoustic model produces the better result than GMM-HMM model. We aim to build a large corpus to be able to use the RNN based acoustic model in online decoding for future improvement in accuracy \cite{sak2014long, graves2013speech, bickerton1994speech}.
